## Additional Content

#### Buy Menu

This project includes a heavily modified Buy Menu originally made by Solokiller in 2016, and heavily modified specifically for this project.
Here are the following commands that can be used in the Buy Menu:

```
// Opening the Buy menu in the chat:
	buy
	/buy
	!buy
	.buy
	\buy
	#buy

// Opening the Buy menu in the console:
	.buy

// Buying a specific weapon/ammo (without the weapon_ins2 prefix) without the menu:
<menu opening command here> <entity identifier here> <weapon name here> ie:
	!buy w l2a3 (will directly buy a Sterling for you)
or
	/buy a l2a3 (will directly buy ammo for the Sterling for you)

// Buying ammo for the current equipped weapon:
<menu opening command here> ammo ie:
	!buy ammo
or
	/buy ammo
```

Server commands (in case you registered the weapons as a plugin):
```
as_command ins2.bm_maxmoney <value>
as_command ins2.bm_moneyperscore <value>
as_command ins2.bm_startmoney <value>
```

#### Replacement Map Scripts

This project also includes replacement map scripts made for specific maps and map series, which will allow you to replace the default weapons and ammo that are spawned by the map with the Insurgency Weapons included in this release.
The maps that currently support this optional feature are: 
* auspices
* sc_toysoldiers
* sc_egypt2
* sc_persia
* suspension
* Restriction Series
* Afrikakorps Series
* Under the Black Moon Series
* Royals Series

If you want to know how to add these scripts, take a look at their scripts in the folder: **scripts/maps/ins2/maps** and add their specific map_script command in the map's *.cfg* file.

#### Optimized World Models

The world models offered in this project are heavily optimized to help increase player performance, both polygon-wise and texture-wise while also keeping visual fidelity with the View Models.  

#### Extras

This pack includes a *.fgd* file in case you would like to use the weapons in your map. Check out [this guide](https://github.com/KernCore91/-SC-Insurgency-Weapons-Project/wiki/Creating-your-own-Register-File) on how to prepare your map script and resources for servers and players.

This pack also includes a test map called: *sc_insurgency*. Use it to try the new weapons out.

## Notes

Some weapons include a mode to change the firerate on them, you'll notice a sprite appear on your screen telling you the weapon's fire mode (Semi auto, Burst Fire, Full Auto), use ***E + R*** (or whatever key your *+use* and *+reload* is bound to) to change them;

Some other weapons also include Tertiary Attack functions (Like deploying the bipod, or changing to the GL mode).
To use these modes simply press the Mouse3 button (or whatever key you bound *+alt1*).

Many models feature textures above 512x512 resolution, including the weapon sprites, so gl_max_size 1024 is required to see the weapon textures without loss of quality.

Usage of this pack without more than 2 GB RAM, outside of servers, is likely to crash you.

The RGO Grenade has an internal impact timer of 1.5 seconds, which means that if it has impacted on any surface during that time, it will not explode on impact.
